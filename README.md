# Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Overview

To help me become familiar JavaScript, I have built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It should have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

The coding quiz must have: 

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock (-10 secs)

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score

(note: the score is calculated by +10 for every correct answer, and +0 points & -10 seconds for every incorrect answer.)
